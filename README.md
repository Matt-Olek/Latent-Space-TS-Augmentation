# Latent Space TS Augmentation
 
 This repository aims at implementing a simple and efficient method to augment time series data using a latent space. The method is based on the idea of using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a latent space representation of the time series data. The latent space is then used to generate new time series data by sampling from the latent space.

 The method is implemented using :
    - [Python 3.12.3](https://www.python.org/)
    - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
    - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Installation
All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
